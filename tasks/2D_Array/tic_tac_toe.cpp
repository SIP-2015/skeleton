//tic tac toe 

//make a tic tac toe game. below is a way to go about it
//bonus : write a computer player that plays randomly 
//(which can be ignored if you want) 

//one way to go about it is to make a 2-D array of chars 
//I would start with a function that would print out the 2-D array

//then I would write a function that takes a char and two ints 
//(this places that char in the array some where)

//then I would write a function to get two numbers from the user
//(making sure they fit in the array, asking again if they enter it wrong)

//write a function that checks for victory
//(take in two ints(just place position) and checks the other sides for the same char
//return true if someone has won, false no one has won   

//then I would make the main game loop which just switch from player1 to player2 
//asking for the different inputs and placing, checking for victory and printing
