/* A point on the two-dimensional plane can be represented by 
 * two numbers: an x coordinate and a y coordinate. For
 * example, (4, 5) represents a 4 units to the right of the 
 * vertical axis, and 5 units up the horizontal axis. The sum
 * of two points can be defined as a new point whose x coordinate 
 * is the sum of the x coordinate of the two points, and whose y
 * coordinate is the sum of the y coordinate.
 *
 * Write a programe that uses a structure called POINT to model 
 * a point. Definre three points, and have the user input values
 * to two of them. The set third point equal to the sum of the 
 * other two, and display the value o the new point. Interaction
 * with the program might look like this:
 *
 *
 * 		Enter coordinates for p1 separated by a space: 5 6
 *
 * 		Enter coordinates for p2 separated by a space: 5 6
 *
 * 		Coordinates of p1+p2 are: 10, 12
