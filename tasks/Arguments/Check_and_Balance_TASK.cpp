 * 	Design an algorithm that will prompt for and receive your current check book balance, 		
 * 	followed by a number of financial transactions. Each transaction consists of a transaction 
 *	code and a transaction amount. The code can be a 'D' for deposit or 'C' for check. your  	
 *	program is to add each deposit amount to the balance and subtract each check amount. After 	
 *	each transaction is processed, a new running balance is displayed, with a warning message 	
 *	if the balance becomes negative. When there are no more transactions a 'Q' is entered as 	
 * 	the transaction code. Your algorithm is to then display the initial and final balance along 
 *	with the number of checks and deposits that were made.
