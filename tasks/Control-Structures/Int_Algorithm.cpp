/*Design an algorithm that will read a series of integers 
 *from the screen. The first integer is special, as it 
 *indicates how many integers will follow. Your algorithm 
 *is to calculate and print the sum and average of the integers, 
 *excluding the first integer and display these values to the screen. 

 DISPLAY: 
 
  Enter the number of entries --> 10
  Enter entry # 1 --> 10
  Enter entry # 2 --> 65
  Enter entry # 3 --> 77
  Enter entry # 4 --> 31
  Enter entry # 5 --> 2
  Enter entry # 6 --> 13
  Enter entry # 7 --> 15
  Enter entry # 8 --> 24
  Enter entry # 9 --> 92
  Enter entry # 10 --> 77
  The sum = 406 and Average = 40.6

  HINT: Set your values as doubles.
