// This assignment has four parts, and will allow you to practice //
// using objects once they have been defined.                     //
// You should complete the four functions below so that they      //
// behave like their comments describe. They will have to use the //
// Robot class to complete their objective. You should have       //
// received a copy of the source code with this assignment. Use   //
// that and the comments on the public methods to help you figure //
// out what tools you have at your disposal to solve the problems //
// at hand.                                                       //
